This is operational version for calculating trajectories.

The SNAP code is in directory source.

The sequence of events for computation is the following:

1. Original file from NRPA is: Test_barsebeck_TRAJ_input (probably windows coding)

2. It is copied to the file nrpa.input (unix coding).

3. Creation of the input file for SNAP with the program: CREATE_SNAP_INPUT

nrpa.input -> CREATE_SNAP_INPUT -> snap.input

4. SNAP run creates files with trajectories: bsnap snap.input

snap.input -> SNSAP -> Trajectory_001_20120906060000_BARSEBECK-1.DAT +
Trajectory_003_20120906060000_BARSEBECK-1.DAT + Trajectory_003_20120906060000_BARSEBECK-1.DAT

5. The output files Trajectory* can be sent to NRPA

Source code for the program CREATE_SNAP_INPUT is in the file creat_snap_input.f

In directory graphics are maps with trajectories, both from met.no and NRPA for comparison. met.no maps are created with the program T with source code in the file tr.f.

This system was tested (Jan Erik Dyve and me) on 07.09.2012 and all worked well.
